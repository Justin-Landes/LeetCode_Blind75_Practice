# Blind 75 Practice Tracker
This repo contains my progress and solutions to the Blind 75 coding problems, categorized by topic and LeetCode pattern.  Big thanks to the website https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=blind75 for hosting the training!

## Why I'm Doing This
This repo supports my journey toward an AI/ML Engineering role.  I am following the LeetCode Blind 75 to build deep pattern fluency, prep for technical interviews, and reinforce the algorithmic foundation behind modern AI systems.  The contents of this repo collectively reinforces:
- The 8 LeetCode coding patterns (Sliding Window, DP, etc.)
- The 5 most-used algorithms in interviews
- My fluency in Python, problem solving, and code clarity

## Weekly Goal
Frequency: Solve 3–5 problems per week.
Focus: Understand the pattern, not just solve it.
Reinforcement: Document understanding and weak points for additional review.
