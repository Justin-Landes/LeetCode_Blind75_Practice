# Blind 75 Practice Tracker

This repo contains my progress and solutions to the Blind 75 coding problems, categorized by topic and LeetCode pattern.  Big thanks to the website https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=blind75 for hosting the training!

## Why I'm Doing This

To build deep pattern fluency, prep for ML/AI Engineer interviews, and reinforce the algorithmic foundation behind modern AI systems.

## Weekly Goal

Frequency: Solve 3–5 problems per week.
Focus: Understand the pattern, not just solve it.
Reinforcement: Document understanding and weak points for additional review.
